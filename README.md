# puppet-manager
trynna make prepping a bit less burnout prone by making it braindead simple
maybe some other things too idk
## todo
change theme, switch to a tabbed interface, migrate from storing data in .py to .json, switch to dictionary for nation list, add tab for putting up tags and poll raiding (possibly stop storing passwords in plaintext but i have no clue what i would switch to for the main site tbh)
